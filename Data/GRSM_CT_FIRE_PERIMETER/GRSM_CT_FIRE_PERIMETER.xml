            <abstract>FIMT is an ArcMap extension developed by the Esriâ€“Denver Professional Services Group that provides all the tools necessary to manage GIS fire incident data using a standardized geodatabase model and map symbology for fire incident mapping. Beginning with the 2005 fire season, FIMT will be the U.S. federal standard GIS application for fire incident mapping. FIMT is based on the Incident Command System (ICS). This method of managing fire incidents was developed for incident response in the United States, and it has been imitated by emergency response organizations around the world. The terminology, processes, and symbols used in the FIMT application have been developed and used by many organizations to standardize the creation of maps used to support a fire incident command. With the adoption of the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the Department of Homeland Security has established ICS as the standard method of incident management organization. FIMT consists of an ArcMap toolbar that furnishes fire GIS technical specialists (GISTs) with all the ArcMap tools they need to manage the GIS data required to produce maps that support a fire incident. As part of FIMT, a standardized geodatabase model was developed for storing fire incident features. This standardized model provides a consistent framework for all fire GIS personnel using FIMT tools. The geodatabase is created by FIMT from a stored database template that is installed with the application. The geodatabase streamlines uploading and processing of fire perimeter information </abstract>
