            <abstract>Soil burn severity dataset created from the BARC image (v2) and field observations by the BAER Team.Non Burn (1-19)Low Severity (20-124 + shadow)Mod Severity (125-199)High Severity (200-254). 
The affect of a fire on ground surface characteristics, including char depth, organic matter loss, altered color and structure, and reduced infiltration. The classification of post-fire soil condition is based on fire-induced changes in physical and biological soil properties. During post-fire assessments, there has been an intentionaleffort to use the term “soil burn severity” to differentiate post-fire soil properties from  fire effects on vegetation (such as tree mortality) and/or general fire effects on long-term ecosystem health. </abstract>
